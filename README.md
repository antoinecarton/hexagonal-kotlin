# Hexagonal-kotlin-playground
Purpose of this project is to implement a hexagonal architecture in Kotlin.

This project is a simple tasks manager with some constraints related to state transitions. See [state diagram](#state-diagram) section for details.

The implementation is using the functional programming library [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/).

Some benefits to use Arrow are:
- Domain is side effect free;
- Domain is easier to test;
- Composition;
- etc.

The project is composed of multiple gradle sub-projects:
- `domain` (free of any external library except Arrow);
- `infra-web` (containing the web server to start);
- `infra-db` (just to simulate a database adapter).

Therefore, domain and business logic are isolated from any infrastructure code.

Ktor is used as a web server, just to learn something new.

This projects may of course receive improvements such as adding integration tests with Ktor...

## Hexagonal architecture
Our business rules and our domain are isolated from any technical implementation. 
Requests are first validated, then processed if valid.

## State diagram
As shown on the diagram, it is not possible to move a task that is cancelled or done. This is simply to have some 
business rules :)

## Run tests
`./gradlew test`

## Run ktor server
`./gradlew run`
